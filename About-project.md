 ## Your users should be able to:
  • Analyze the character, word, and sentence counts for their text
  • Exclude/Include spaces in their character count
  • Set a character limit
  • Receive a warning message if their text exceeds their character limit
  • See the approximate reading time of their text
  • Analyze the letter density of their text
  • Select their color theme
  • Navigate the app and perform all actions using only their keyboard
  • View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
  • See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Ideas to test yourself
  • Add more counters (e.g., lines, spaces, etc.)
  • Add a word density graph along with the letter density graph
